Data Structures
=========================================

Pypam implements two main data structures, a :class:`AcuFile` and a
:class:`ASA`. 


AcuFile
-------

The :class:`AcuFile` represents a wav file containing underwater sound data. It provides several methods
to perform acoustic analysis. 


Overview of Attributes and Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A short summary of a few attributes and methods for AcuFile is
presented here, and a full list can be found in the :doc:`all attributes and methods page <reference>`.


ASA (Acoustic Survey Analysis)
------------------------------

A :class:`ASA` is essentially a wrapper to perform different 
functions in a folder containing more than one acoustic file. 


Overview of Attributes and Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :class:`ASA` class allows to perfom any of the methods available 
in the :class:`AcuFile` but on all the files of an Acoustic Survey. 

A short summary of a few attributes and methods for ASA is
presented here, and a full list can be found in the :doc:`all attributes and methods page <reference>`.
