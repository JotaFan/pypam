About
=====

pypam is a python tool which pretends to facilitate the acoustic processing of .wav files resulting from
underwater acoustic deployments. It is a combination of all the (found) existing tools for acoustic processing,
and it allows the processing of several deployments with one line of code, so it is easy to create datasets to
work with.
pypam is oriented to extracting features that can be used for Machine Learning algorithms or to the extraction of
broad acoustic information in time-series.

This project has been funded by `LifeWatch Belgium <https://www.lifewatch.be/>`_.
